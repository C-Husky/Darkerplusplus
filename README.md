Darker++ is a dark theme installer designed for Hammer++, providing an improved visual experience for both Hammer++ and Windows.

The project combines the application of a dark theme on the Windows operating system with the replacement of Hammer++ DLLs, ensuring that the program works 100% in dark mode.
